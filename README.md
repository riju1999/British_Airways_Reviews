### Task  - Web scraping to gain company insights

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for Britis Airways was collected from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).

Following insights were uncovered as they are summed up in the one slide presentation.
